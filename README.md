# Page Flip Animation website #

This small project allows to create a **simple page-flip animation** effect that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After every click on the "Flip page" button, it turns the next page in the book. That gives us a smooth flipping animation like turning pages in a real book.

## The structure ##

- **index.html** which is the main HTML file for a book structure and a button
- **styles.css** which is the main CSS file for a flip animation and a styling
- **script.js** which is the main JavaScript file that controls the page flipping
